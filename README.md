# App Template
This is a basic App template to get up and running with `iOS` or `macOS` projects quickly.

To get started:
- Clone this repo using one of the methods described [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)
- Run the folloiwng in the cloned repository:
```
make
```

Running `make` will [bootstrap](Documentation/Commands.md#bootstrap), [rename](Documentation/Commands.md#rename), and [run](Documentation/Commands.md#run) the project for you.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è All installation can be undone with the [`make unboostrap`](Documentation/Commands.md#uninstall)

üéâ Happy coding

## Caveats

- See issues list for improvments and outstanding features
